CS344 HW1 - Matrices

### Questions

1.If I create a function to validate the matrix before passing it to one of the operations. In the event that the matrix is 
 not valid (i.e. not tab delimited, does not contain at least one element, etc), can I output my error message to stderr from 
 that function and exit (with a non-zero value)?
